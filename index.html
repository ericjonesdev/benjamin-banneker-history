                <div><p>Benjamin Banneker was born free in 1731., was an African-American naturalist, mathematician,
                    astronomer and almanac author. <br>He was a landowner who also worked as a surveyor and farmer.
                    Banneker's knowledge of astronomy helped him author a commercially successful series of almanacs. He
                    corresponded with Thomas Jefferson on the topics of slavery and racial equality. Abolitionists and
                    advocates of racial equality promoted and praised Banneker's works. Although a fire on the day of
                    Banneker's funeral destroyed many of his papers and belongings, one of his journals and several of
                    his remaining artifacts are presently available for public viewing.
                    <br>
                    So great was his personage in history that the names of parks, schools and streets commemorate him
                    and his works, as do other tributes.
                    <br>
                    In 1737, Banneker was named at the age of 6 on the deed of his family's 100-acre (0.40 km2) farm in
                    the Patapsco Valley in rural Baltimore County. A letter writer stated in 1791 that Banneker's
                    parents had sent him to an obscure school where he learned reading, writing and arithmetic as far as
                    double position. However, the remainder of Banneker's early life is not well documented.
                    <br>
                    Around 1753, at about the age of 21, Banneker reportedly completed a wooden clock that struck on the
                    hour. He appears to have modelled his clock from a borrowed pocket watch by carving each piece to
                    scale. The clock continued to work until his death. He was also an avid reader and purchased his
                    first book, the Holy Bible, on January 4, 1763. An important event for the scientist, he wrote this
                    date on the title page. Benjamin Banneker transitioned on October 19, 1806.

                <p>
                    Benjamin Banneker was one of the most famous black men in colonial America. He was a farmer, a
                    mathematician, an inventor, an astronomer, a writer, a surveyor, a scientist, and a humanitarian.
                    When he surveyed the city of Washington with Major Pierre Charles L'Enfant, Banneker became one of
                    the first black civil servants of the new nation. Along with a team, Banneker identified the
                    boundaries of the capitol city. They installed intermittent stone markers along the perimeter of the
                    District. The SW-9 Intermediate Boundary Stone of the District of Columbia, located in Arlington,
                    Virginia, is still in place. The east side of the stone bears the engraving, "Virginia" and the
                    north side, "1791,‚Äù the year Banneker helped survey the city.

                <p>
                    After returning to Ellicott's Mills, Banneker made astronomical calculations that predicted eclipses and planetary conjunctions for inclusion in an almanac and ephemeris for the year of 1792. To aid Banneker in his efforts to have his almanac published, Andrew Ellicott forwarded Banneker's ephemeris to James Pemberton, the president of the Pennsylvania Society for Promoting the Abolition of Slavery and for the Relief of Free Negroes Unlawfully Held in Bondage.<br>
Pemberton then asked William Waring, a Philadelphia mathematician and ephemeris calculator, and David Rittenhouse, a prominent American astronomer, almanac author, surveyor and scientific instrument maker who was at the time serving as the president of the American Philosophical Society, to confirm the accuracy of Banneker's work. Waring endorsed Banneker's work, stating, "I have examined Benjamin Banneker's Almanac for 1792, and am of the Opinion that it well deserves the Acceptance and Encouragement of the Public."
