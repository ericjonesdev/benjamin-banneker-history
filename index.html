                <p>Benjamin Banneker was born free in 1731., was an African-American naturalist, mathematician, astronomer and
                    almanac author. He was a landowner who also worked as a surveyor and farmer.</p>
                <p>Banneker's knowledge of astronomy helped him author a commercially successful series of almanacs. He
                    corresponded with Thomas Jefferson on the topics of slavery and racial equality. Abolitionists and
                    advocates of racial equality promoted and praised Banneker's works. Although a fire on the day of
                    Banneker's funeral destroyed many of his papers and belongings, one of his journals and several of
                    his remaining artifacts are presently available for public viewing.</p>
                <p>So great was his personage in history that the names of parks, schools and streets commemorate him
                    and his works, as do other tributes.</p>
                <p>In 1737, Banneker was named at the age of 6 on the deed of his family's 100-acre (0.40 km2) farm in the Patapsco Valley in rural Baltimore County. A letter writer stated in 1791 that Banneker's parents had sent him to an obscure school where he learned reading, writing and arithmetic as far as double position. However, the remainder of Banneker's early life is not well documented.</p>
                <p>Around 1753, at about the age of 21, Banneker reportedly completed a wooden clock that struck on the hour. He appears to have modelled his clock from a borrowed pocket watch by carving each piece to scale. The clock continued to work until his death. He was also an avid reader and purchased his first book, the Holy Bible, on January 4, 1763. An important event for the scientist, he wrote this date on the title page.</p>

                    Benjamin Banneker was one of the most famous black men in colonial America. He was a farmer, a mathematician, an inventor, an astronomer, a writer, a surveyor, a scientist, and a humanitarian. When he surveyed the city of Washington with Major Pierre Charles L'Enfant, Banneker became one of the first black civil servants of the new nation. Along with a team, Banneker identified the boundaries of the capitol city. They installed intermittent stone markers along the perimeter of the District. The SW-9 Intermediate Boundary Stone of the District of Columbia, located in Arlington, Virginia, is still in place. The east side of the stone bears the engraving, "Virginia" and the north side, "1791,‚Äù the year Banneker helped survey the city.
