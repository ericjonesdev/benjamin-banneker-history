## 1.3 Design


To serve as a historical website, a simplistic but functional design was needed. This combination served two primary purposes. The first purpose, simplicity, was used to maintaine a pleasant look and asthetic to cater to younger users, while having content structures that would appeal to teachers and higher acedmics. 

Where applicable, accessibility and useability regarding color schematics, semantic markup, and overall structure where adhered to. 

The familiar colors red, white and blue were used due to the subject matter and his assistance in designing the American captial. The home decor color "rule" of 60%, 30%, and 10% was applied to the genre of web development, so as not to over-use one color while relying too heavily on another.

The rule for color uses was as follows: 60% white tones, 30% blue, and 10% red tones.  This made for an eye-pleasing user experience. 
 
To accomodate for the variying viewport types, media queries were employed for overall responsiveness across platforms.
